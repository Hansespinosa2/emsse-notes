\subsubsection{Dynamic Systems}
A system is some kind of object that interact with and produce signals.
An input $u$ enters the system that is controllable by the user alongside a set of uncontrollable but observable inputs $w$.
There are additional disturbances that influence the system but are not observable or controllable $v$.
